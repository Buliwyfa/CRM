# Upgrading from 2.6.0 or 2.6.1:

If you're currently on 2.6.0 or 2.6.1, you'll need to patch SystemService in order to get an automatic upgrade: https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/pull/2126

This involves updating line 109 of src/ChurchCRM/Service/SystemService.php to 
```
mkdir($backup->backupDir,0750,true);
```
instead of 
```
mkdir($backup->backupDir,0644,true);
